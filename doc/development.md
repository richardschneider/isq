The development process is aligned with [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).  Whenever, a successful commit is made to the `master` branch it is automatically published as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isq).

## Making a change

To make a change
* If no done already, then fork the project
* Create a new branch
* Make you changes and then push them
* Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

Please make sure you **add a test** to prove your change works.

When the pull request is approved, it is merged into `master` and released to npm.
